# supervised_learning
Repository of notebooks used to complete assignment 1.  The code covers analysis that was desired for assignment 1 but its not very cohesive, but all code required for a particular model is found within the notebook with the models name. 

## Usage
Assuming python 3.9 and conda are installed create the env using.
`conda env create -f ML.yml`

Open jupyter
`jupyter notebook` execute code as needed

# make a directory 
`mkdir data`
download both of these files into data

# Note
The parent directory path inside the notebooks will need to be changed to reflect absolute path to the `data` directory
